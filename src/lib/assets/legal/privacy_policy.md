## 1. Our Philosophy
**Data Minimisation**  
We treat your privacy seriously. We only collect the minimum personal data necessary to provide our Service. We do not sell your information or share it with a third party without your prior consent.

**Data Sovereignty**  
You own the content and data you provide to us. It’s yours, not ours, and you are entitled to access it, update it and ask us to delete it any time.

**Privacy by design**  
Our Service, software and processes are designed with privacy in mind. We do not store your data longer than necessary and we make sure it’s easy for you to request a copy or to request that it be deleted.

**Open by default**  
To the extent that we can, everything we do is in the open. We strive to put our source code and processes under open source licences, free for people to review. We will inform you should there be any changes in our rules.
